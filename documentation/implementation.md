# Markov chain sentence generator
The goal of the project is to create a program that can generate sentences based on an input of text, e.g. one or more books, poems, articles, musical lyrics, etc. Presumably the program will generate sentences in a similar style to the given input text.

## Program structure
First the input text is processed / cleaned by removing special characters, breaking the text up into sentences, and tagging the parts of speech for each word in the text.

The program then creates a trie structure where, depending on the order of the Markov chain, each word from the source text followed by the next n consecutive words are stored along with the frequency at which they occur in the text.

The program can then generate text according to the Markov process with probabilities for a subsequent word from the trie.



The picture below shows how words are stored into the trie.

In this example, if we have the words 'cats eat', we then select the next word ('when', 'alone', 'after') according to their relative probabilities. The probability that the word 'alone' gets selected next is 2 / (3+2+6). If it gets selected, the next word pair is 'eat alone' and we select the next word the same way, and so on.

## Input and output
The input is a text file with the text on which the sentence generation will be done, e.g. some book as a text file. The output will be text generated by following the Markov chain.
