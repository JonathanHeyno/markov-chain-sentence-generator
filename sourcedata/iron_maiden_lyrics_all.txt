I get in from work at 2 AM
And sit down with a beer
Turn on the late night TV
And then I wonder why I'm here
It's meaningless and trivial
And it washes over me
And once again I wonder
Is this all there is for me
Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own
Life seems so pathetic
I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed
These walls that fall in on my mind
Hold on for something better
That just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on
And try to take the hurt
Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own
Oh
Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own
Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own
Alone again
Alone again
I'm here on my own

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout, "Let the creatures out!
We'll show the unbelievers"
Napalm screams of human flames
For a prime-time Belsen feast, yeah
As the reasons for the carnage cut
Their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The body bags and little rags
Of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain
To put the finger right on you
As the mad men play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight, all night

If you're feelin' down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness? (Madness)
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me
There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high.
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns.
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving (doing it again)
Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high

Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear, 'cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground
When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die
God let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come, thy shall be done on earth
Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?
But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say
Afraid to shoot strangers

Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled
War horse and war machine
Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood
In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?
Once a ploughman hitched his team
Here he sowed his little dream
Bodies, arms and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades dead or dying lie
I'm left alone asking, why?
In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
What is it all when the battles are done?
After the war
I mean no one has won
I'm just a soldier
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all their lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war
So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victim's minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low
So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream
You can't protect yourself even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals they laugh right in your face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves our kids from crime the trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just
So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream...

Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain
Looked into the abyss, called it by its name
I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us
My dreams of empire from my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus
I am Dr. Dee
And this is my house
I am the master of the tides
I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres
Across the years
Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain of the demons set free
Strange alchemy
Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command
Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning
My dreams of empire from my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus
I am Dr. Dee
And this was my house
I was the keeper of the books
I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear
I cast a shadow through the years
Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain of the demons set free
Strange alchemy
Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain of the demons set free
Strange alchemy
Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Restore the knowledge memory
Strange alchemy

"My son ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a God amongst mortal men
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon

Look inside your head and find
Tell me now and it's all in your mind
Look inside your head and find
A way deep inside and it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Revolution, air pollution
Chairman Mao Tse Tung is in your mind
(But he's dead pal, he's not very well anyway)
New day breaking-people hating
Love's a dream and it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Segregation, preservation
Politicians all are in your mind
Pewter suta, Karma Sutra
Even Blanckenheimer's in your mind, yes
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind

Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again
Do you feel lucky
Or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings
And the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
What will the next day bring?
Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send
An angel to mend?
Best make decisions
Before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again
Nothing to lose
But so much to gain
A little danger
It goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end
Gate open to heaven
Is ready and waiting
Or straight down to hell
Can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone
Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?
Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I could save your life? (Hmm)
There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again
You have been warned
But still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn
The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take
Decisions to make
Arrive at the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait
It may be too late
Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?
Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

As I lay here, lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is? I wanna know
Please, won't you tell me, it's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today
As I lay here, lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is? I wanna know
Please, won't you tell me, it's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today
As I lay here, lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is? I wanna know
Please, won't you tell me, it's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

Now I'm here, can you see me?
'Cause I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold
Tell me you can feel me
'Cause I'm here
Here I am, can you see me?
Passing through, on my way
To a place I'd been to
Only in my dreams before
In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
'Cause you can count your
Real true friends on one hand
Through life
There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would
Die for you?
Thought not
Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say
In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one
Right now
In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're
On the outside
Looking in?
You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power
If you want to
It's true
You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does
Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?
There are some who're wise
There are some who are born naive
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?
As for me, well, I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case
Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?
You know I feel so elated
'Cause I'm about to find it out
And when I know all the answers
Maybe then I'll come back
To fill you in
You, don't be alarmed now
If I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
One day

Now the contracts out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you
It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you
I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways
I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Assassin, assassin
Assassin, assassin
Hahahahaha
I'm in a cold-cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer
And as you walk through the light
I feel my hands going tight
Excitement running through my veins
I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger
I feel adrenalin rush
It's just the final touch
You can kiss your ass goodbye
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again, in the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
Back in the village again, in the village
I'm back in the village again
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
Back in the village again, in the village
I'm back in the village again
But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name
Back in the village again, in the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again, in the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village, I'm back in the village
I'm back in the village again

Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making your money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers
You got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead
See what's ruling all our lives
See who's pulling strings
See what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place
The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
Be quick
Or be dead
Be quick

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

Sometimes it makes me wonder
Sometimes it makes me question
Sometimes it makes me sadden
Always, it makes me angry, but
When you can see it happening
The madness that's all around you
Nobody seems to worry
The world seems so powerless to act
It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day, a new toll
Another assassination
The same day, a new creation
But what are they coming into
Security of a world that brings
One day, another killing
Somewhere, there's someone starving
Another, a savage raping
Meanwhile, there's someone laughing at us
It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
Each day, it goes on
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Blood on the world's hands
Brutality and aggression
Tomorrow, another lesson
Expecting another air raid
Praying for a ceasefire
They say things are getting better
No need to be complacent
There's chaos across the border
And one day, it could be happening to us
It's out of control
Blood on the world's hands
It's our epitaph
It's out of control
Someone should know
Blood on the world's hands
Someone should—

Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that's rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons of their underworld haunts
The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfil man's desire
By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld
A life that's full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise
The ultimate sacrifice
Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The search for the truth, the book of souls
The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn
They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown
Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies
Prophecy of sky gods
The sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages
Forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins
Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed
Domain of the earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves mayan slaves
Defeat of the dark lords
The ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule
The book of souls

Dying swans, twisted wings
Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life
In this garden of fear
I have seen many things
In a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home
Wilderness, house of pain
Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind, dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real
Those who know will not tell
All is lost, sold your souls
To this brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
Dragon kings, dying queens
Where is salvation now?
Lost my life, lost my dreams
Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams, laughing here
Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned
In this brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
Dying swans, twisted wings
Bring this savage back home

We are not the sons of God
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning
Shadow fingers rise above
Iron fingers stab the desert sky
Oh, behold the power of man
On its tower, ready for the fall
Knocking heads together well
Raze a city, build a living Hell
Join the race to suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell
Out of the the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed
Yellow sun, its evil twin
In the black the winds deliver him
We will sleep to souls within
Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven
Out of the the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Burying our morals and burying our dead
Burying our head in the sand
E equals MC squared, you can't relate
How we made God with our hands
Whatever would Robert have said to his God
'Bout how he made war with the Sun?
E equals MC squared, you can't relate
How we made God with our hands
All nations are rising
Through acid bells of love and hate
Chain letters of Satan
Uncertainty led us all to this
All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Cold fusion of fury
Divide and conquer while ye may
Others preach and others fall and pray
In the bunkers where we'll die
We're the executioners, they lie
Bombers launched with no recall
Minute warning of the missile fall
Take a look at your last day
Guessing you won't have the time to cry
Out of the the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns
Holy Father, we have sinned

Honey, it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
Unchain your back door
Invite me around

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Let her go!

Honey, it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees, honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
Nowhere, no way, no place to hide
Let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Gonna get you!

So you think you can own me?
Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now, woman
'Cause I ain't like those other men
There's something burning inside me
That makes me want to be free
And when I get these feelings, honey
You better keep away from me
There's things in life now, baby
That I know I've got to do
And I need your love now, baby
To help me see it through
So you think you can own me
Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now, woman
'Cause I ain't like those other men
Look out, yeah
So you think you can own me?
Well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now, woman
'Cause I ain't like those other men
There's something burning inside me
That makes me want to be free
And when I get these feelings, honey
You better keep away from me
Can I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness? There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness? The prophet looked and he laughed at me, ha, he said
Can I play with madness? He said, "You're blind, too blind to see"
Oh, said, "You're too blind to see", mmm
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said, "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I said, "You'll pay for this mischief"
"Ah, in this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hellfires raged in his eyes
He said, "Do you wanna know the truth, son?"
"Lord, I'll tell you the truth"
"Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness? There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness? The prophet looked and he laughed at me, ha ha, he said
Can I play with madness? He said, "You're blind, too blind to see"
"Oh, listen to me, " said the prophet
Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness? There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness? The prophet looked and he laughed at me, ha, he said
Can I play with madness? He said, "You're blind, too blind to see"
Can I play with madness?

If you had the time to lose,
An open mind and time to choose,
Would you care to take a look,
Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side,
Time is always on my side.
Can I tempt you, come with me,
Be Devil may care, fulfil your dream,
If I said I'd take you there,
Would you go, would you be scared?
Time is always on my side,
Time is always on my side.
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me,
Safe as any soul can be ... honestly,
Just let yourself go.
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time ... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time ... oh oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing,
You try to hide your deepest sins,
Of all the things that you've done wrong,
And I know where you belong.
Time is always on my side,
Time is always on my side.
Make you an offer you can't refuse,
You've only got your soul to lose...
Eternally... ah ah let yourself go!
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!

There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery, yeah!
He's got your Chains of Misery
There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says: "You're damned!"
And you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear
He smelt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
It's only love that holds the key to your heart
It's only love
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
He's got your Chains of Misery

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", It's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aww, 'cause you're making...
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Aw, 'cause you're making...
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love

I'd sail across the ocean
I'd walk a hundred miles
If I could make it to the end
Oh, just to see a smile
You see it in their faces
The sadness in their tears
The desperation and the anger
Madness and the fear
No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here
Starvation and the hunger
The suffering and the pain
The agonies of all-out war
When will it come again?
The struggle for the power
A tyrant tries again
Just what the hell is going on?
When will it ever end?
No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, just greed is here
You see the full moon float
You watch the red sunrise
We take this things for granted
But somewhere someone's dying
Contaminated waters
Pollution and decay
Just waiting for disease to strike
Oh, will we learn someday?
No hope, no life, just pain and fear
No food, no love, no seed
Childhoods end

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would have crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought oblivion, well, it beckons us all
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Now it's burning his hands
He's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're children of the damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
You're children of the damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight
Children of the damned

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes
I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems the powers getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
I fell reborn again

Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race that is part of a clan
To live on highlands
With the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean
When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free
Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans
Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
It's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
Ancestors could hear what is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free has written in chains
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
And I swear to defend
I will fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
We'll fight for a land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want
I am the clansman
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We're the land of the free
No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We're the land of the free
No, no we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
No we can't let them take anymore
We're the land of the free
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans
Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

When I stand before you
Shining in the early morning Sun
When I feel the engines roar
And I think of what we've done
Oh the bittersweet reflection
As we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns
Become the ghosts of time
Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion
Just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away our land of birth
To Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
Curving on the edge of daylight
'Til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night dreaming
'Til the Sun is born again
Stretch the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
A speck of dust in cosmic sand
Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic
Over mariners stormy graves
We will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away our land of birth
To Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
To Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay
Coming home, far away
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay

Hey girl, what you doin'?
Hey girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is about you
But I like it a lot
Oh, why don't you let me hold you?
Let me feel your lovin' touch
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane
Hey girl, I got something I think you wanna know
Hey girl, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms and feel your love tonight
Oh, I'm never gonna let you go 'cause I like your charms
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
I wanna feel your love all night
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
I'm gonna make your telephone work tonight
Communication breakdown

Como está, amigo?
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer?
They will never know we care
Shall we keep the fires burning?
Shall we keep the flames alive?
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right?
No more tears
No more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears
And if we do forget them
And the sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again?
Shall we dance a dance in sunlight?
Shall we drink the wine of peace?
Shall our tears be of joy?
Shall we keep at bay the beast?
No more tears
No more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigo, no more tears
Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquished
Only horror, only pain
No more tears
No more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigo, no more tears
No more tears
No more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos, no more tears

Who would be a poor man, a beggar man, a thief
If he had a rich man in his hands?
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth
If he could take it from the money man?
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contracts but she always plays it clean
She dines in Hampstead Village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along
a poor man's rich girl
And she'll do it for a song
a rich man's stealer
But her favor's good and strong
She's the Robin Hood of High Gate
Let the poor man get along
Laughing in the playground gets no kick from little boys
Would rather make it with a letching gray
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
She signs no contracts but she always plays it clean
She dines in Hampstead Village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school
Cross-eyed Mary
Oh, Mary
Oh, Cross-eyed Mary

There are more things in heaven and earth
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
Out of thing that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more (officer I swear)
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move
Feeling scared I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
That is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
At the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I steped onto the coals
And I felt that I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them
They had ascended from hell
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
As I danced with the deadb my free spirit was laughing
And howling down at me
For my undead body just danced the circle of death
'Til the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
Didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh yeah
By luck then a skirmish started and took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind but behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare was to look just straight ahead
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it
Hey, Chile
Everywhere
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

We buried our sons
We turned and fled
No growing old
The glorious dead
But we came back
Because one man said
Now on the beaches
The blood runs red
I faced them down
The only one
I stood alone
And warned the day would come
But they were wrong
Appeases every one
And not for the last time
We all stand alone
I watch the sun move away
As I embrace the night
And my black dog has it's day
For six long years, you shall not pass
Barbarians at the gates
We will overcome
Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour
The darkest hour
To blaze in glory like a dying sun
One last burning giant
'Til Jupiter moves on
Turn the ploughshares into swords
You sons of Albion awake
Defend this sacred land
Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
The darkest hour
Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
Before the dawn, the darkest hour

A war in heaven in God's rage
He put me in this burning cage
Holy fury locks me in
Imprisoned by my deadly sin
Every hour the shadow king
Wonders what his cloth will bring
I've lived and loved and that's for sure
My fatal quest forevermore
The days of future past, to wander on the shore
A king without a queen, to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
Once crucified, you forgave it all
But my own life condemned to fall
Where's the glory in your name?
My twisted soul still burns in flame
Hark you angels, hear my call
Father, witness to my fall
Between the lines of sin and pain
I walk the earth now doomed again
The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
The days of future past, to wander on the shore
A king without a queen, to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
The days of future past, to wander on the shore
A king without a queen, to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The road, it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust, cry it out loud
Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead
The burden of blood, the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake
Lord above, my spirit says
Death is not proud, no more, no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory
Wither a pain that's almost a joy
Wander there, my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Strangely, no wonder memories remain
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger one
Sent to do reckoning, what must be done
Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty, freedom, maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done, faithfully
Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay
Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear, my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now, embrace it my friend
Spirits cry for a God from the grave
In darkness, fortune favours the brave
Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore
Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore
Think I am, that I'm almost there
Following now the depths of despair
Beyond the light, darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all
Falling now where God can't explain
Bidding farewell, the life I'd have gained
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts

I see the enemy
I know he can't see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score
Took a bullet in my brain
Inside I'm the king of pain
Outside you will fear my name
I ride a blood red triplane
Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong
Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame
Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train
I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting beam attack
I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day
Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong
Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame
Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train
Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong
Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame
Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train
Death or glory
It's all the same
Death or glory
The price of fame
Death or glory
I'm in the game of
Death or glory
A one way train

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realize you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost?
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
In 13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die, ha! ha!
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, die!

You lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day by day
I though I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what my future held that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearn
Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn
Don't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for me
Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn
Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way to view the world
I would like you to know, when you see the simple things
To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn
Don't want to be here - somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there, I might find it's not for me
Don't know what I want or where I want to be
I'm feeling more confused the more the days go by

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know am going fast
Doctor doctor, please.
Don't you know I just them lead
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to take my body apart
*Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just them lead
Doctor doctor, please,
Don't you know am going fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation for a nervous boy
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know am going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just them lead
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, and I can't take any more
*repeat
I'm on the run

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night comes down
Feel someone's watching you
You've got to get away
Is it the first time
You've ever felt this scared?
Feel the adrenaline pump
Your heart begins to race
Begin to run now
The sweat runs down your face
Don't know which way to turn
You'd better hide yourself
He's getting closer now
You'd better improvise
Just hope you never reach
The point of no return
Could be the last time
You see the light of day
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to, don't look to
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the night goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Don't look through the eyes of a fool
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger
Somebody's watching when the light goes down
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now? Is it really happening?
Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind
All my hopes and expectations
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
All my hopes and expectations
Looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization
That I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
Please save me from myself
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away from drifting
Saving me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost a nightmare I retrace
Lost a hell that I revisit
Lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence
Lost a nightmare I retrace
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true

Walk away
Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?

'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah

He threw down a glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honor
Fight for the splendor
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fight for the honor
Fight for the splendor
Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
Oh, oh, fight for the honor
Fight for the splendor
Fight for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fight for the honor
Fight for the splendor
Fight for your life
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the Reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honor
Fought for the splendor
Fought for the pleasure
Oh, oh, fought for the honor
Fought for the splendor
Fought to the death

I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend
For a week I have been waiting
Still I am only in Saigon
The walls move in a little closer
I feel the jungle call me on
Every minute I get weaker
While in the jungle they grow strong
What I wanted was a mission
And for my sins they gave me one
They brought it up just like room service
'Cause everyone gets what they want
And when that mission was all over
I'd never want another one
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know Captain that you've done this work before
We've got a problem you can help us I am sure
The Colonel's gone rogue
And his methods are unsound
You'll take a PBR up river, track him down
There's a conflict in every human heart
And the temptation is to take it all too far
In this war things get so confused
But there are some things which cannot be excused
He's acting like a God, an insane lunatic
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice
Your route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
Here is the file and it's all you need to know
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Here I am the knife in my hand
And now I understand why the genius must die
Now I stand alone in darkness
With his blood upon my hands
Where sat the warrior, the poet
Now lie the fragments of a man
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend
I've looked into the heart of darkness

I am an educated fool
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do
About this awkward situation
That's been forced down right upon me
As I'm walking down into
On my own into the Valley of life
Got a lifetime of experience
Yeah I've got so much to give
Open the page at chapter one
Could this just be that life's just begun
Forever within your darker thoughts
Reflecting on everything you've been taught
Never felt this way before
Seems that somebody's just opened the door
To the book of life or is it death
Is there ever anyway out
Someone's looking down on me
To the very inner core of my soul
They won't tell me what they see
But I really want to know
I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return
Do you really wanna be
Just another one statistic or feel
That you really should aspire
That you really do deserve more
Do you ever really feel
That you have so much potential inside
What you really have to give
Could be realised so much more
I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
I want to go and see the fire burn
I want to see and feel my world turn
I want to know what more there's to learn
I want to pass the point of no return
Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow
Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow
I want to feel what life's like respond
I want to meet my father beyond
I want to walk right into the light
I want to feel no fear but delight
I want to leave my life on my own
I want to lift the unturned stone
I want to walk right into the fire
I want to live out all my desires
Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow
Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow
Time will flow
And I will follow
Time will go
But I will follow
The educated fool

Gotta tell you a story
On a cold winter's night
You'll be sailing for glory
Before you know what is right
So come over here now
I got a vision for you
It's my personal snake oil
It's just something I do
I'm the jester with no tears
And I'm playing on your fears
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death
The eternal lie I've told
About the pyramids of gold
I've got you hooked at every turn, your money's left to burn
You'll be wanting a contract, ha
You'll be waiting a while
I'd like to give you my contact
But that isn't my style
Well you only get one chance
And it's too good to miss
If I didn't lie to you
Then I wouldn't exist
Greed, lust and angry pride
It's the same old, same old ride
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me
I'm a clever banker's face
With just a letter out of place
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me
El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try
So gone is the glory
And gone is the gold
Well if you knew the story
How come it has to be told
Well you can say I'm a devil
And I wouldn't say no
But out here on the dark side
Hey, on with the show
So now my tale is told
Big and bad and twice as bold
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow
There is no easy way
For an honest man today
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away
El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try
El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try

To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion
Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Related giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
The millionth chance they laughed, to take down his majesty's craft
To India they say, magic carpet float away, an October fateful day
Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His majesty's airship, the r101
She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum rolled tight, a canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come
The fury yet to come
In the gathering gloom, a storm rising in the west
The coxswain stared into the
We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for the politicians he can't be late
The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
A fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come
Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king, and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground
Said the coxswain, sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight
Said the captain, damn the cargo, we'll be on our way tonight
Groundsmen cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast
Baptizing with her water, from the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past
Feeling the wind as it blows you
Feeling the beams as they pass you along
Watching the channel below you
Lower and lower, into the night
Lights are passing below you
Northern France, asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you
A million to one, that's what he said
Reaper standing beside you
Wind inside cuts to the bone
Panicked to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves
The cover is ripped and she's flooding
Rain is flooding into the hold
Bleeding to death and she's falling
Lifting gas is draining away
We're down lads, came a cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last
Here lie their dreams as they stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines they run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
Dreams live on
Dreams live on
Ooh
Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast
Eight and Forty souls who came to die in France

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
But I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Balancing on a ledge, living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, someday I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on, yeah
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil, the evil that men do
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do
Everyone's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV
Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill
I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end time
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life ever after
Everyone's looking at death from the sky
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies
I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end
So I watch and I wait
And I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?
So I watch and I wait
And I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand?
Future memory of our tragedy?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know I am the only one
You and only god would know what could be done
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face all this on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
Cause I am the chosen one

Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
And some of us are here just so that we'll die
How come the bullet hits the other guy
Do we have to try and reason why
Be it the devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove
Be it the devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind
Be it the devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

We live our lives in fever
In a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream "Don't touch!"
I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night body is a flame
We live in fever...
I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies
I remember a time when we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night body is a flame
Fever ... we live in fever
Now we live in a world of insanity
Fear is the key to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die
I hear your silent heartbeat
I hear your silent cries
Ohhh your just in lies lies and lies
The kids have lost their fredom
And nobody cares till somebody famous dies...
Keep telling lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies
I remember the time when we used and abused
Ah was just lies
I remember the time we thought that passion was free
Ah was just lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies
Hear the night
We live in fever
Now we live in a world of insanity
Fear is the key to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Have a phobia that someone's always there
When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew, to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil man
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honor

As the sun breaks, above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun (yeah)
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God, my father I'll fly
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
Yeah
Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly
Fly as high as the sun

Are you a man of peace
Or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you
Don't know which anymore
So many full of life
But also filled with pain
Don't know just how many
Will live to breathe again
A life that's made to breathe
Destruction or defense
A mind that's vain corruption
Bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing
Or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe
A holy war winner
They fire off many shots
And many parting blows
Their actions beyond a reasoning
Only God would know
And as he lies in heaven
Or it could be in hell
I feel he's somewhere here
Or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like
The blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know religion has a lot to answer for
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
And as they search to find
The bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are
Scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins
And all because of it
You'd think that we would learn
But still the body count the city fires burn
Somewhere there's someone dying
In a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying
Stupidity of man
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
He gave his life for us
He fell upon the cross
To die for all of those
Who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us
To feel the pain again
Tell me why?
Tell me why?

After the war
And now that they've sent us homeward
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own
No one can see just what this conflict has done to
The minds of the men who are on their way home
I'm scarred for life
But it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can I face the torment alone
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light
People say "Don't worry"
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're saying
I am living in my own world
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time
I hear voices in my head
Could I really be going crazy
In the night the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die
When you laugh are you really crying
You're not sure what's real anymore
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war
Whoa oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh
Whoa oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
No pain anymore
Fortunes of war
Sometimes I wake
I feel that my spirit's broken
I wonder if I've the strength
Carry on
Carry on

She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more, more, more
But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh
But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were, two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Get on your M11
Get on your bikes
Hahahahaha

On a cold October morning
As frost lay on the ground
Waiting to make my move
I make no sound
Waiting for the mist to cover all around
I carefully picked my time
Then took the wall
I'm sick and tired of running
The hunger and the pain
A stop to look about then off again
Being at the wrong place
And at the wrong time
Suspected of a hit that was my crime
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name
Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack
Ever moving onwards
Always on the run
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name
Even if I find them
And get to clear my name
I know that things can never
Be the same
But if I ever prove
My innocence some day
I've got to get them all to make them pay
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name
I am a fugitive being hunted down like game
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name

I'm running out of my time, I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting so I can't sleep at night
In the day, feel like dead
I'm getting in far too deep, I feel them closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared, I know they'll win
Even so, I'm prepared
Do you believe, what you hear?
Can you believe, what you see?
Do you believe, what you feel?
Can you believe?
What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Whenever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm the only one who feels
That I know what is real
Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this, then I will be gone
Maybe then, you will see
Do you believe, what you hear?
Can you believe, what you see?
Do you believe, what you feel?
Can you believe?
What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal
Do you believe, what you hear?
Can you believe, what you see?
Do you believe, what you feel?
Can you believe?
What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal
What is real?
Futureal

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?
Dead men, tell no tales
In gangland, the murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
In gangland, where the jail birds die
Aaa aaa com' on
A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail
Dead men, tell no tales
In gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Dead men
Dead men
No more
In gangland you tell no tales

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights
To the woman and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened the book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a God to save you, if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you, if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no, I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be the Angel of Death has come for me
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying
Go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day

Beginning of a sunrise bores a big hole in the sky
Not to reason why that armed children are in this world
And fighting in the name of God's way
Mourning bleak and utter waste
The vanity of the world is assured now
Prey upon the weak no more
The spirits of those who are gone
Propaganda of the battles
That are lost or won
And count your blessings still alive
Of those who managed to survive
Inside oblivion of that hell on Earth
All you have been, all you have seen
Lost in somewhere in your dreams
How the angels they have fallen
All is nothing what it seems
And the voices that you hear now
And the voices in your head
Now are thinking of a lifetime
You can never feel again
I wish I could go back
I'll never be the same again
Bled for all upon this hell on Earth
And when I leave this world
I hope to see you all again
On the other side of hell on Earth
Upon the eyes of good
I'm following the light again
In between the dark of hell on Earth
On the other side, I'll see again in heaven
So far away from this hell on Earth
You dance on the graves who bled for us
Do you really think they'll come for us?
Knowledge and virtue, taken by lust
Live on the edge of those that you trust
You think that you have all the answers for all
In your arrogant way only one way to fall
Burning a lamp that is fire in your hands
Taking you further from these lands
Love in anger, life in danger
Lost in anger, life in danger
Love in anger, life in danger
Lost in anger, life in danger

Believe in me, send no money
I died on the cross and that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke
They choose what they want to hear, they don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
They're saving your souls by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey
Holy smoke holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work, making holy smoke, yeah
Making holy smoke
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records burning books
Holy soldiers Nazi looks
Crocodile smiles just wait a while
'Til the TV queen gets her make-up clean
I've lived in filth I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
Holy smoke holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work, making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke
Smells good
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer a hundred years in jail
Holy smoke holy smoke, plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work, making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke

I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature, what kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back, looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
She's tied up, she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed, she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you, hooks in you
I've got those
Hooks in you

I can't see my feelings
Open my eyes
I can't see my feelings
Up in the pale moonlight
I can't see my feelings
Keeping me high
I just keep on reeling
Honey please tell me why
I can't stand there dreaming
All of the time
Music sends a feeling
Up in the pale moonlight

Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothen in white
Stand in the light
Here is the soul of a man
Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man
When the world was virgin
Before the coming of man
Just a solemn witness
The beginning of the end
From a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And the human race
We are strange believers
All of us
There are stranger truths
In molten rust
We rise from slumber
It calls our name
Recalls our number
How bad we come
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
To God's illusion
Which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fall
The angels come
And angels go
But the lord of light
Shining below
Eternal blackness
Beyond the stars
We think our wisdom
Will get that far
At the master's table
The table's bare
No line of plenty
Devastation, despair
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of your time
If eternity should fail
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending your time
If eternity should fail
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reefing a sail on the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Good day
My name is necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul
And I suck the lives from my bed
I own two sons, I gave them breath
And I fill their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgotten
For me, eternity is nothing but a short while

Sometimes when I feel the anger
Sometimes when I'm all alone
Sometimes when I feel surrounded
Like all the doors are closed
I feel like I've been a prisoner
I feel like I've been a tool
Let people try to judge me
When they're not in my shoes

I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change

Some people are only happy
When they can watch you fail
And to them every day is
Another coffin nail
I think that I've found the answer
I think that at last I know
We've only got one lifetime
I'll make my life my own

I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
To live my own way

I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say 

Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation, waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end?
And will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me, so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though its reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist? Well, me I'm neither
But wouldn't you like to know the truth?
Of what's out there, to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?
Yeah, oh
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams, ow
There's got to be
Just more to it than this
Or tell me, why do we exist?
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began, yeah
My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began, yeah
I'm running away, nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know, yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you, yeah
Ah yeah
No, I'm running

Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgment day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders, pillaging
Invaders, looting
Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders
Fighting
Invaders
Marauding
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away to fight another day
Invaders
Raping
Invaders
Plundering

Vikings are coming

Won't you come into my room?
I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood
I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow
As it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought
Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever,
Wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you
No matter how far
See the blood flow
Watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

See the blood begin to flow
As it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought
Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever
Wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you
No matter how far
See the blood flow,
Watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Won't you come into my room?
I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood
I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow
As it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought

Watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

I can hear them floating on the wind
Immortal souls their weeping saddens me
Mother earth you know your time is near
Awaken lust the seed is sown and reaped
Through the western isle I hear the dead awaken
Rising slowly to the court of Avalon
The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy
Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny
All my days I've waited for the sign
The one that brings me closer to isle of Avalon
I can feel the power flowing through my veins
My heart is beating louder, close to Avalon
I can hear you, can you hear me?
I can feel you, can't you feel me?
Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead of the pyre
I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth holy blood of the dead
Mother earth I can hear you
Sacrifice, now united
Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
Keepers of the goddess in the underworld
Holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them
Nineteen maidens, guardians of the otherworld
Mortal conflict born of Celtic legend
That apart from seven, non-returned from Avalon
Mother earth I can feel you
My rebirth now completed
Fertility mother goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruits of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of mother goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest, throw the dead on the pyre
To have the belief of others
Looking for the Isle to
Show them a sign
Fertility of all mothers
Stood in silence
Waiting now for their turn
The gateway to Avalon
The island where the souls
Of dead are reborn
Brought here to die and be
Transferred into the earth
And then for rebirth
I hear her crying the tears of an Angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth holy bloodof the dead
The water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly
Are flowing and flooding the land
The sea shall return once again just to hide them
Lost souls on the Isle of the dead

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death
And he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping
And we'll dream forevermore
And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows remain with our hands
Deeper grey, come to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
Oh
But the memory still remains
All the past years not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around
In your life, you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
Oh
In your life, you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Oh
I know what I want
I'll I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll I say what I want
And no one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no one can take it away
Oh

Lights out
We live in a world Of darkness
No doubt
Everything's up for sale
We sleep
All of the world is burning
We pray to god for a better deal
Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is?
Can I go now?
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide
Fight wars
Die in a blaze of glory
Come home
Meat in a plastic sack
Fall down
Better pray to your God for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean
Nothing is sacred
Back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is?
Is that it now?
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide
I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas my guide
Judas my guide
Whispers in the night

There are no marks upon a man
That can say he's good or bad
No label and no tell tale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day
When you look into their eyes
You don't know what they hide
No label and no tell tale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day
Ignorance is bliss is that the reason
We can not read another's mind
If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each others heads
Would we all be driven mad
Would we all be dead
By your deeds you will be known
Time will tell truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all step closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On judgement day
On judgement day

A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life
You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the Tarot cards
And throw them to the wind
Your question your beliefs, your inner thoughts
Your whole existence
And if there is a God then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace
If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing
Or leave it all the same
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud
Of what you've done
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life now I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
All of my life now I have believed
Judgement of Heaven awaits for me
All of my life now I have believed
Judgement of Heaven awaits for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life now I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me

You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood-lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
I can see what a knife's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?
Ooh yeah, I've done it
Yeah
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood-lust defies all my needs
Ooh look out, I'm coming for you

Tell you a thing
That you ought to know
Two minutes of your time
Then on you go
Tell tale of the men
All dressed in black
That most of them
Not coming back
Sent off to the war
To play little games
And on their return
Can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas
Has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes
Removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds
Death knows no bounds
How many get well
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools
And to think that we thought you the answer
I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now
Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesise
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the façade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome
You had us all strung out with
Promises of peace
But all along you cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well
Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance... at least
Take the world to a better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy
You now... will leave
We seem destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life - well there's hope
That man won't self destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow man
With more respect and a shake of their hands
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is
Becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance
Is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones
But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
Fight fire with fire life is cheap
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care
They benefit from death and pain and despair

I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near
Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you?
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear?
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again
And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going 'round in my head
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again?
As the ominous light draws near
This lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here
Only God will know
You're sitting alone, you watch
As the wind is blowing treetops
And the swaying rustling of leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall
Only God knows
The whole sky glows
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Only God knows
The whole sky glows
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice
Maybe lightning strikes twice

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more 'til the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run 'til you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
The mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile
Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile
Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

In the gloom the gathering storm abates
In the ships gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate
All summers long the drills to build the machine
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to armageddon's reach
Overlord, your master not your god
The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who sent them here
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death enter hell's gates
Sliding we go, only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
The rising dead, faces bloated torn
They are relieved, the living wait their turn
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name
You still go on, to hell and back again
Valhalla waits, valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil
Blood and sand, we will prevail
Sliding we go, only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through
How long on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through

All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced
Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fear within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell
It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To the shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Here's for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you tell to me alone
I can't reach things I can't see
You don't see this strange world
Quite the same as me
Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal
These are things you can't reveal
We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man
Infernal sacrifice of hell
Fire breathing lead the way
Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one
Revenge is living in the past
Time to look into a new millennium
Spiral path leads through the maze
Down into the fiery underworld below
Fire breathing lead the way
Lucifer was just an angel led astray
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
We are not worthy in your black
And blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a
Shadow on us all
And all our sins to you we give this day
Others wait their turn
Their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us
We are cast out by our bloody father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world the only one we trust
SOLO
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

I don't care for this world anymore
I just want to live my own fantasy
Fate has brought us to these shores
What was meant to be is now happening
I've found that I like this living in danger
Living on edge it feels... it makes me feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong it's reality
Killing so we survive wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide we've got to get away
I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality
I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to believe what we've become
Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something within us
We are lord of the flies
Saints and sinners
Something willing us
To be lord of the flies

All is not it seems to be on the outside
Sometimes what appears to be is a show
What shows in the face is only a mirror
We all have some better places to go
We don't know just what we have 'til we've lost it
Until that time comes and know that it's gone
So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago
Tear myself away from thoughts in my head
The people worshipping the sun
And all the children point up to the sky
They see the eagle as it floats on the wind
And they follow with their spirits high
Buffalo roam on the plain
We walk into the flames but dance for rain
The hallowed dead in sacred ground, the elders
And we wash away their sins for them
Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race
And the testament to ancestors that are never to retrace
Burn the flame of innocence as they ride into the sun
Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon
Holy ground and sacred earth now
Revisit stolen youth
Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying in sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying in sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Standing on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Playing at sacred ground
Will we ever heal our old wounds, like forever darkness worn
Fighting for their lives again so come on now, don't be afraid
This is where destiny lies, just to let us breathe again
Put upon this earth to wander and to walk forever lost
With the ashes of our enemies to live among our ghosts
Of our past fear nothing, life is but a better path to joy
Nowhere to go, nowhere to run, our whole nation overrun
Itself existence under threat and soon will be none of us left
Remember names of all our dead now in enemies that fled
Reaching for our sky forever, free a sadness that is proud
As the clouds all drift away now
Until we meet again

Like a man without a home
Watching people come and go
Carry on their daily lives
Without a thought for the ones alone
Cast the dream aside like throwing
A pebble into the ocean tide
And I'm feeling so alone again
Free the angry from their pain
Free the captives from the chains
Cast aside the doubt that
Nothing good can come their way again
Living in a world of lies
No matter how or hard we try
Living life without a dream today
Looking through a mist of truth
That we believe an elusive cloud
The things we find are hard to say now
That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die
Now we need to know the truth now
Open our eyes that we can see
So we live and breathe again
Better days for you and me
Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away
As one turns against the other
With a brother against brother
Situation like no other, it's a picture of despair
As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those who don't know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what's ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more
As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those
Who don't know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time
And we see what's ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more

The freeway is jammed
And it's backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
'Cause nothing is fair just you look around
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down...
He's sick of waiting of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free
You can live by your wits
Once he built missiles a nations defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city he leaves in his wake
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down...
The freeway is jammed and its backed up for miles
The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be
What we deserve we just don't get you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven are they looking down
Nothing is fair just you look around
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down...
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down...

As he travels on the beast of burden
Moving up along the mountainside
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride
As he journeys across mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty 'round him
Feeling empty inside
He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved
He's searching for the answer now
It's something that he's managed to avoid up 'til now
Real conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner than later
Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strive for all the harder things in life
But what the cost of give in now?
His life and his time are the only things that he has
Life is is not a rehearsal
All he has is the one chance to get it right
Leaving really is the only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
But now the pain of lying too early in the grave
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace
He tries to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but it's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is it possible to change such a lot?
He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says, an eye for an eye
In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgments that will haunt him 'til his grave
No one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice, so be it
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace
Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace
Far, far away, the man wo would be king
Far, far away, the man wo would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
Far, far away, the man wo would be king

At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo
Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit is forced to yield
There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but doesn't care though
In fact, he doesn't care at all
The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear
If God is in the heavens
How can this happen here?
In His name, they used the weapons
For the massacre
There is a point below zero
Where the sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead in the sand

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunted, hunter, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hands tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning inside
Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
As we kill them all so god will know his own
The innocents died for the pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars to die and be free
The book of old testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Religion's still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
As we kill them all so god will know his own
The innocents died for the pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
Still burning heretics under our skies
As we kill them all so god will know his own
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust
The eye of the triangle smiling with sin
No passover feast for the cursed within
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars to die and be free
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the born-less one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare, to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream, ow
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide, you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons, battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die, oh, oh
One more dies and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you young man
But I'll see you damned in endless night
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

Sitting, waiting in the falling rain
Getting ready to begin again
Wounded, lying, crying bodies moving, dying
All around there is the smell of death and fire
Here the planes are coming
Hear the soldiers running
Killing on a scale to comprehend
Why are we here?
In this place, here to kill
Please God, forgive us for what we have done
I always thought I was doing right
As of now, I'm not feeling so sure
I'm at a place of where I give no grace
I'm a soldier of war
I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
I cannot think of about the things that I have done
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done
You tell me what is certain but I'll tell you what is true
You tell me what is honesty when all around is death and cruelty
I'm making out, my mind is vile, I'm giving in to our desires
Within the truth that lies within the only thing
Mother of mercy, angel of death desire
Mother of mercy taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy, angel of pain
Mother of mercy taking my last breath
Some say you are a lost cause, some say you're a saint
Just being here's and act of suffering and restraint
Walked down a long dark road to ruin and panic not
I'll die a lonely death, of that I'm certain of
Rivers flow with blood, there's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive
Sick of all the killing and the reek of death
Will God tell me what religion is to man?
I don't hold with bad religion, understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it, I just don't hold at all, you know it
You say you are a holy man but what is it you do?
From where I stand there's nothing but a hollow man I see
Mother of mercy, angel of death desire
Mother of mercy taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy, angel of pain
Mother of mercy taking my last breath
Mother of mercy, angel of death desire
Mother of mercy taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy, angel of pain
Mother of mercy drawing my last breath
I'm just a lonely soldier fighting in a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting, who it is, or what I'm fighting for
Thought it was for money, made my fortune, now I'm not so sure
Seemed to just have lost my way

Mother Russia how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow
Mother Russia poetry majestic
Tells the time of a great empire
Turning 'round the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by
Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Be proud of what you are
Now it has come
Freedom at last
Turning the tides of history
And your past
Mother Russia
Dance of the Tsars
Hold up your heads
Remember who you are
Can you release
The anger the grief?
Can you be happy
Now your people are free

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strollin' through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Vite before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last, there's someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothin' at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started runnin' away
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is lookin' for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy
Murders in the Rue Morgue
runnin' from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start runnin' blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be lookin' for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm runnin' from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
runnin' from the arms of the law
Murders in the Rue Morgue
runnin' from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm runnin' out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime?
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before
Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts to give it away
New life in a day, some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from hell
And who is my God and where is my soul
Too tired to jump, too young to run
Never ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of our heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
I want to end my life now but I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The devil has planned
Never ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of our heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Never ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of our heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?

There's a darkening sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
Wishing all my life away
No one can stop me now
Time is up, it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait 'til then
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
Wishing all your life away
No one can stop me now
Time is up, it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies


There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you truth
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose
When i've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end
God give me the answer to my life
God give me the answer to my dreams
God give me the answer to my prayers
God give me the answer to my being

She's got legs... like an airship
She's got an arse.... like coal tip
She's got tits... just like hot air balloons... and I mean the Hindenburg!
She's the biggest girl, I'm gonna get there soon
Yeah, you know what I mean

She's got love when you want it, but she never let's go when you get it
You disappear inside, you're never seen again... lost forever
She's soon there get gonna I'm girl, biggest the
Alright, here we go

Should be some kind of guitar solo here
Well I met her in a bar, she was propping up the wall
I don't think she was available, she was made of concrete stars
I met her in a bar, she was propping up the wall
In fact she was nailed to it
I gotta admit, babe... let's get down to it baby!

She had a brain like a sheep-dip
She got love like a cesspit on her mind
She was a big girl, she was big
I mean she was big, she was fucking huge!
Enormous!
Needed a sign overhead!
You could have sailed the Hindenburg through her legs and never even have landing permission!

One more!

Oh I wish she would cross the ocean with me
Oh we sailed across the ocean you and me
I looked like a flea on the back of a sperm whale
Oh yeah, I was waving a match inside the Albert Hall! 

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells
No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you were a mystique that's on your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius

Woe to you, oh earth and sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe?
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
'Cause in my dreams it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Night was black, was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?
Six six six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
Six six six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
Six six six, the number of the beast
Six six six, the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time it waits for no man
My fate is sealed
If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell, ha, ha, ha
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

Hold a halo round the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the Universe
Your burden is the way
So there is no better time
Who will be born today
A gypsy child at day break
A king for the day
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again
Dusty dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beuty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain
But we must endure it, to live again
A man who casts no shadow has no soul

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods
Of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet
Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet
Come the demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime it's all too late
Before you know the crime it's all too late
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet
Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of decimation
Out of the silent planet
Come the demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of decimation

When the moon will rise again
Until we read the Parthian skin
Broken fears, warring days are here again
'Fore we all to dust descend
Heaven knows when life will end
God to know in the mire, put out the fire
Know there is a cross to bear
In your primal quest of fear
No quarter, now is given no less
Aslumber was my main ideal
Asunder did my spirit steal
Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace
Sweet revenge will be ours
Vengeance of a shaken world
Just remember that patience is no sin
And to find another way
Live to breathe another day
Lord of light in the darkness, our guide
In a tempest never shaken
Edge of doom is not mistaken
Countenance is not a sin
Gallant king, we bow to him
Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin
Dark and bitter, deep within
Invader punished with his life
Vanquished in the morning
Sea of blood in light divine
Unholy reverence enjoyed
Intoxicated with their hell
Man immortal sickness dwell
Savage beasts troops engage
Assembled here to butcher blades
Smoke has darkened in the air
Smell of death and deep despair
Wilderness, a tyrant dream
Sell your soul, not give them power
Slay upon imperial crown
Witness now the witching hour
Bound himself to oath and king
Such loyalty, a shameless thing
Youth of agony still burn
Shedding parents blood
Never say a prayer to me
For this crime, treachery
Drinking from your cup of wisdom true
Many men will follow you
Now an army is raised
And our Gods, they be praised
Death is but a gilted edge
Shall no more than we will pledge
Hear the cry
We are ready to believe
The prodigal has returned
Give us our own revenge
With the power he learned
We will burn the same again
A betrayal of angels in a foreign land
A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand
For all those who have written in the sand will be told
That the same will happen
Searching for gold
Like a fire in the sky
I can feel strength return
Heading for afterlife
Meet me there

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Kill time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and end of us all
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to god no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die on Paschendale
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale
Oh, oh, yeah
I've been lookin' so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding, in hiding
Behind that false mask
And you know that I know that
You ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait, for the curtain to fall
But knowing the terror and holding
You have on us all
Yeah, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from
Your mesmerizing catcall
Ooh
Keep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray, from the narrow way
I'm running and hiding
In my dreams, you're always there
You're the phantom of the opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul
It just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

The keys to death and hell
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
The pilgrims course will take
Quelling the devils might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Holy battles take their toll
Liberty and hope divine
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell
Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun
To courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water, clean our guilt
With us do what you will
Then will my judge appear
Bear no false angel that I hear
For only then I will confess
To my eternal hell
Now give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell
Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun
Now give us our holy sign
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of heaven to hell
Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun
Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the Eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a god
And he will die too
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man God preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number two
Who is number one?
You are number six
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going out
If you kill me, it's self defense
if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye I will defy
You'll be afraid when I call out your name
Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going

Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that bring me to my knees
Oh, help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please
I feel unsettled now, I know that I've done wrong
Messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh Lamia, please, try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh-oh
Oh Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh-oh

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me
It is so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends
impending disaster
(Souls crying) the devil's laughter
I Heard the cry of the seven whistlers
(Lucifer smiles, looks on and waits)
I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my visions
Heed what I say and you'll see
What will be
Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought down a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed
souls lost forever
(Life after death) or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
(Now Lucifer laugh, hell awaits)
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes, in my visions
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing, all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling a
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing, all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Oh yeah

When it all comes down the line
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming, "Rolling thunder"
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet
One way ticket outta here
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend it's ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
Breaking strain is fast approaching guns and riots
The politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
And the Press get fed the scapegoats
Public Enema number one
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend it's ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend it's ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend it's ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

Thinking of an age, old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now, I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me? I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future shadows overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh well, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please, take me away
Take me away
So far away
Please, take me away
Take me away
So far away
Please, take me away
Take me away
So far away, hey!
Thinking of an age, old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now, I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul

Memories rising from the past
The future shadows overcast

Take me away
So far away

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man

In the heat of the morning
When your day is still dawning
And your bird, he's singing
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away
Pack your bags in a hurry
Because your mind's in a worry
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me
'Cause I'm so tired
Yes, I'm so tired
So tired
Yes, I'm so tired
In the heat of the morning
When your day is still dawning
And your bird, she's singing
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away

When I was wandering in the desert
And was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun
And I know of the pain, that you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears
And I know of the pain, that you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives
That are sealed and are now far away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears
And I know of the pain, that you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

The morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find?
See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can't get out just a feeling of dread
I know this burden's a heavy load
A dark mistake never ending road
The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger he counts his stash
The joker's wild like an impish child
While madame fortune she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search destroy
The ones below human decoy
I need somebody to save me
Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck, the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one
You hedge your bets, the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line between good and bad
And cast the luck, be happy sad
I need somebody to save me
The red and the black
People don't want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away
The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden's a heavy load there is no doubt
The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have?
The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time
I need somebody to save me

Let me tell you about my life
Let me tell you about my dreams
Let me tell you about the things that happen
Always real to me
Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why
Why should these curses be laid upon me?
I won't be forgiven 'til I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
Pay for my sins with the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone reach for heaven from hell
My sins are many, my guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing of hiding what I know
I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh heavy down on me
I know they're crying for help reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnate still in me live again
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this hell
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring Salvation
To exorcise this hell
Someone to save me
Something to save me from my hell
A destination
Away from this nightmare
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this hell

Unchain the colors before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the
Oh
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the sky
Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the
Fire, oh
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

"Oh, God of Earth and Altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the Hanged Man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind
You'll see
The venom tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are opening
You'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn
The light of the blind
You'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are opening
You'll see
Go
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
Is the watcher in the ring
It is You, oh
It is You



Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on
The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm
The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me
"Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and
All the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."
There calls the mariner
There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?
See... onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but here's two
Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, 200
She, she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one
"One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one."
The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he
And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins
The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on



The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammers down
In the oily sea-the killing ground
His knuckles white his eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care
Runing silent, runing deep, we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep
Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when?
The lethal silver fish will fly
The boat will shiver-men will die
A cast of millions-a part to play
Killer? victim? or fool for a day
Obeying an order-men have to die
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie
Runing silent, runing deep, we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself-you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
'Stern tubes ready', 'aim and fire|'
They can pin some medal on your chest
But in two more weeks-dead like the rest
Runing silent, runing deep, we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep
Runing silent, runing deep, we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare


White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came, too much for Cree
Oh, will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards, attack
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's a game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives
Run to the hills
Run for your lives

Ok
Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, oh I'm running free
I spent the night in an LA jail
And listened to the sirens wail
They ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, oh I'm running free
Get out my way
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, oh I'm running free
Break
Pulled her at the bottle top
A whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free
I'm running free yeah, oh I'm running free
Oh
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
I'm running(I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
Ooh, yeah-yeah
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
Ooh yeah, I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
I'm running (I'm running free yeah, I'm running free)
Yeah


Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law, oh
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
Well I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha)
I can howl in the rain (ow)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
But now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
So give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight, tonight
Love me tonight

I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice
The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through
Desperate calls
Signal back from satellite
As my life flashes right in front of me
Try again, must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time
Not much time, hear my call
Please get through, I am here
I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't a chance of getting away
Too close to the sun, I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I think of my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait 'til my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
If I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Done more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
And tell them that one last goodbye
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
The final frontier
There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find
For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them that one last goodbye
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier


Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness
When all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go
Out in the night somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
On the sea of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness

Beat the warning, the sound of the drums
Set the beacons afire for them all
Call to arms all the men, far and wide
Have to fight now for dynasty, pride at stake
The invaders repel from the north
Keep out nomads who came from the plains
Northern grasslands awash with them all
Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us
Rallying round to the call
We can hear, far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall
Survive on ledges bitten in dust
Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust
Really believe that they're coming for us
Dancing on graves of those who bled for us
Driven away by our endless desire
Defeat by anger and our greatest fire
Attack again and try as they might
Hold them again and see them running
Rallying round to the call
We can hear, far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall
Hear them coming, ready now we wait
Must be steadfast, must be patient
Must believe in that we can win
What will save us? The great wall
Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now
Have to believe that we can repel them
Faith in the years our ancestors taught us
Have the belief that we can protect the wall
Try if they can, we will overthrow them
Fight to the last, they can never own us
Battle of wills, we'll fight to the last man
Honour our dead so they never fought in vain
Hold our fortune, avenge the merciful
Hold the great wall, never fall again
Arrows falling, dark oblivion
Live in spirit, live to tell our sons
Rallying round to the call
We can hear, far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall


Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Ohhhh!
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Ohhhh!
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
Then they watch the progress he makes
The good and evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers before it's too late
Ohhhh!
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
And so it shall be done


Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that's been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness
Listen closely to the raven's call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man's laugh
The fear that's inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin
As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I'll take my last breath
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I'll take my last breath
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin
Into the valley of death fear no evil
We will go forward no matter the cost
Into the valley of death follow me now
Bring me your souls and I'll make it our last
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn't die
Mind over matter, cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin


Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away
Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Caught by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming
Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength
Some they would call it a penance
Why am I meant to face this alone
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise
They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes
They'll be coming to claim
Take your soul away
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator my God, lay my soul to rest
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross, yeah
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
The sign of the cross
Lost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins away


Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
That will be black over a night
One way ticket now returned
My shootin' stars are vastly burnt
On the edge that we can't see
Let's shot the moon, you and me
And that particular you'll see
A just too lonesome galaxy
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night
I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race
I don't know where I don't know why
But somehow back in time again
I'm on the edge you can't see
Another take your love at night
A single party call on me
You won't be trackin' me by sight
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
We slip into the night


Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin
You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have no mortal face
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear me call
We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun
All the oxygen that trapped us in
A carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear the sirens of the dead
Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving Damocles still hanging
Over all their promised trust
Walk away from freedoms offered
By the jailors in their cage
Step into the light, star tripping
Over mortals in their rage
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight
The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose
Virgins in the teeth of God
Are meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me
And Iill feel the life that you live less
Step into my light, star tripping
We will rage against the night
Walk away from comfort
Offered by your citizens of death
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight
Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived
Look into our face reflected
In the moonglow in your eyes
Remember you can choose to look
But not to see and waste your hours
You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short
I see your past and future
All the same and it cannot be bought
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight
Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived
The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose


Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me
Oh, I've never felt so strange
But, I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do
Oh, they drain my strength away
Oh, they're asking me to stay
Nightmares, spirits calling me
Nightmares, they won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now, I feel they are so near
I, begin to see them clear
Nightmares, coming all the time
Nightmares, will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too
Oh, we'll drown together
It, will be forever
Nightmares, forever calling me
Nightmares, now we rest in peace

How do you read a madman's mind?
Teach me the art of war
For I shall bring more than you bargained for
Give me an ultimatum
That I could not dream of
Spills of a crying nation
Upon my soul
For I have not a mortal soul
That you already know
Look at my eyes
There's no surprise
Ocean is black, the devil's track
Looking beyond, beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark, I feel the pain
It's hidden but I can't explain
A cross to bear
A heavy faith
My sorrow whispers
Time again
I hear you calling my name
Come to claim my life again
Pray for me, I'm almost there
The pain almost too much to bear
I try to find my way back home
To feel the same again
The voice of nothing listened far too long
Little by little, eat away
I think I've lost my mind
Too late to change now
What I left behind
Hear me, listen to my call
I am ready to fall
Lord, hear me now, let me go
Ocean is black, the devil's track
Looking beyond, beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark, I feel the pain
It's hidden but I can't explain
A cross to bear
A heavy faith
My sorrow whispers
Time again

Well, you killed your first man at thirteen
Killer instinct, animal supreme
By sixteen you had to learn to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your rite
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last, nothing was the end
I'll make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade, break you both in two
Break you both in two
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
And it's rolling still


Trace your way back fifty years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah

Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodlust
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner

Nail that Fokker, kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more, ha ha ha!

Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers, one big bomb, yeah hey, ooh

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner 


When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life
Will I ever see my countrymen again?
As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk to the harborside
I glance back one last time
Fleeing our nation
Our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide
We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee
Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not what is will be
We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
We run from the evil tongues
Rash judgements, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again
As we sail into ocean size
And lose sight of land
A face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams
Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails
But the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come
No, there's no one going back
No, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we won't die
As we ride the rough seas
As we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive
Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews
Their phantoms follow us
Spirits sails, they drive us on
Through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas
Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds outsoar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth, that we now crave
Is many leagues from safe
Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand
Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold
Blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold
Heaven's rain upon us falls
Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter
Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman
We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favor just for once
Welcome greeting our new land
The elation in our hearts
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land
Weary limbs fatigued away
I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing left to give
Must find the will to live
Never thought that we could make it
Truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from
Never wanted it to end this way
Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman
Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman


All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise
The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There's something that inside has died
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown
Who motivates the motivator
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all okay
But tomorrow is another day he must get through
He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown
Tears of a clown
Oh
Tears of a clown


It's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hall
Where you're going lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light this is real
And so you go to war
For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference? All the same
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colors don't run from cold bloody war
There is no one that will save you
Going down in flames
No surrender, certain death
You look it in the eye
On the shores of tyranny
You crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom with your
Lonely unmarked graves
For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference? All the same
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colors don't run from cold bloody war
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colors don't run, from cold bloody war
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colors don't run from cold bloody war
These colors don't run from cold bloody war



When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost
At what price a life is lost?
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes take just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
The thin line between love and hate
The thin line between love and hate


Put to the sword by an impish whim
Follow me now to a place we begin
Wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear
Devilish children playing here
Hidden in silence, below barren waste
Confusion, hunger, am I still awake?
Have I ever told you about my time machine?
Sit you down, I'll tell you everywhere I've been
I have lived a long life, life extraordinaire
Let me tell you about it, let me take you there
Does it really matter, it's all in the mind
Let me tell you 'bout it, listen what you'll find
I am not a preacher
I am but a man
You cannot imagine
What I've seen and done
I have lived a long life, I have seen the world
I will tell you stories, hair will stand on end
Stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls
I have seen a God's face, I have no disgrace
I have seen the Gods cry, howling in the wind
Where do I get started, when can I begin?
I am not a preacher
I am but a man
You cannot imagine
What I've seen and done
Ooh-ooh
Sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes
Father and sons, give me all of your lies
The brutal truth that is never a lie
Full moon is out as you look to the sky
I am not a preacher
I am but a man
You cannot imagine
What I've seen and done
Open your heart and I'll open you soul
Even in quieter moments, I know
I am not a preacher
I am but a man
You cannot imagine
What I've seen and done
Eerie collection
Darkness is there
Wedded to danger
Betrothed to despair


He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sand worms and the Freemen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
On the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it you would die
On the desert, the planet Dune
Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the mice
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand
Against evil
The fire that spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end


Cold as steel the darkness waits
It's hour will come
A cry of fear for the chosen worshipping the sun
Mother natures black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of Eden
Shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires
Sunrise is gone
Sunrise is gone
Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas
There's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise words from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
Is this the end the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not the journeys end, it's just begun


ith fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We were meant to fight another day, oh, oh
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan, oh, oh


She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?
Ah can't you see me?


When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see?
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self belief or be satisfied?
Do you even think you like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else?
Is there something that you'd rather be?
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
Feel the paranoia creepin' in
Like a cancer eatin' at the skin
Do you think you've lost your self esteem
And your self respect, what can you expect?
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away
All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away
Are you scared to look inside your mind?
Are you worried just at what you'll find?
Do you really wanna face the truth?
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose?
Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think?
Are you strong enough to release the guilt?
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away
All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away


There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned
Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies
And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
Without a conscience they destroy
And that's a thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds
They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it
All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it
The rats in the cellar you know who you are
Or do you?
Watching beginnings of social decay

Wasted years!
One, two, three-
From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
Travelin' on, far and wide
But now it seems I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes and I think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is? You never miss it til' it's gone away
And my heart is lying there, will be 'til my dying day, Adrian!
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
Realize you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say, hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry, throw my hands up to the sky
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
Realize you're living in the golden years, hey!
So understand, Adrian!
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
Realize you're living in the golden years
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
Realize you're living in the golden years, hey!


Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up 'til now I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days
Of sunrise to sunset, of sunrise to sunset
Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters, I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Sands are flowing and the lines are in your hand
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love, in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of nights


The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool?
Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back
You're a weekend warrior when
You're one of the crowd
But it's over
Just look at you now
Look at you now
Just look at you now
Just look at you now
You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins
The adrenalin's high
Feel the tension
Maybe someone will die
Someone will die
Someone will die
Maybe someone will die
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe
You ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe
You ain't that way anymore
You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why
It's hard to say why you got involved
Just wanting to be part
Just wanting to belong
To belong
To belong
To belong
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
Some of the things that you've done
You feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game Isn't it?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on Monday?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do on Monday?
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe
You were never like that at all

Look for something that is hard to find
Searching somewhere deep inside your mind
Hope you find just what you're looking for
Heaven's waiting with an open door
If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then
The road to ruin is a long road to hide in
We signed our lives away to have an escape
It's something that will be whatever our fate
There's no use in hiding got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying this is the last
There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying none of us decide what is our fate
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Is this the last together maybe this time now
We stand together and we're holding the line here
There's nothing we can do just sit here and wait
The die is cast that is deciding our fate
There's no use in hiding
Got to keep on trying
Can't take no more lying
This is the last
There's no time for crying
When some of us are dying
None of us decide
What is our fate
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives
Now with nothing to hide going nowhere
Take my chances and stand by their sides
When the river runs deep
And the line breaks
And the blood it flows
Free from our lives.


Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard? Have you heard?
He sees them in the distance, when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow?
They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know? Did you know?
As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows
Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us?
Have you heard? Have you heard?
There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it it will never be the same
Did you know? Did you know?
He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know
They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know? Did you know?
He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows
He sees the picture on the wall it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face
Saying Grace
Remember times they had they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be gone
They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come
They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and wait
Can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
When they found them had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows


My telescope looks out into the stars tonight
A little speck of light seems twice the size tonight
The calculations are so fine
Can it be growing all the time?
Now I can't believe it's true
And I don't know what to do
For the hundredth time I check the declination
Now the fear starts to grow
Even my computer shows
There are no errors in the calculations
Now it's happened take no other view
Collision course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do
When two worlds collide
The anger and the pain of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide when two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide
Now it's happened take no other view
Collision course, you must believe it's true
Now there's nothing left that we can do
When two worlds collide
The anger and the pain of all those who remain
Two worlds collide
Who will be left alive
No place to hide when two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
Of those who remain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
So who will survive
There's no place to hide
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
The anger, the pain
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide


It's snowing outside
The rumbling sound of engines roar in the night
The mission is near
The confident men are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on
But still they must fly
No one should go
Where eagles dare
Bavarian alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night
They fall through the sky
No one should fly
Where eagles dare
They're closing in the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
They make their way
But maybe too late
They've got to try
To save the day
The panicking cries
The roaring of guns are echoing all around the valley
The mission complete
They make to escape away from the Eagles Nest
They dared to go
Where no one would try
They chose to fly
Where eagles dare

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

One two, one two three four
I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exercise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go
And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I want to be
Make my wildest dreams come true
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again
When I remember back to how that things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappear so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell
When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna breakaway
I'm gonna breakaway
I'm out on my own, I'm out on my own
C'mon break away, break it away
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna breakaway

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
And dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh, yeah, yeah
Say it doesn't matter
Ain't nothin' gonna alter the course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you ooh, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh, yeah, yeah

Beehive hairdo, 45 on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders, don't you give her no whip
Took me to the station for a breathtest
then back to the bedroom for some house-arrest
Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but, Oh! They feel so warm
Coming back to London on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle to see what I could see
She leaned over said; COFFEE, TEA OR ME ?
White apron, brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
BROKE MY LEFT LEG, sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night
Women in uniform, Women in uniform
Women in uniform, Women in uniform
Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita, she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a STEN gun
Baby, I surrender, let's have some fun
Women in uniform, Women in uniform
Women in uniform, Women in uniform
Women in uniform, Khaki, white and blue
Women in uniform, coming after you
Women, women, Women in uniform
Women, women, Women in uniform
Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but, Oh! They feel so warm


Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds
All that's left of what we were, it's what we have become
Once our empires glorious but now the empire's gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done
Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
A land of hope and glory, building graveyards for the brave
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding?
Holding on to fury, is that all we ever know?
Ignorance our judge and jury all we've got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon, holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes, when the burning sky is done
A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
The earthquake is a coming, but you don't want to hear
You're just too blind to see
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding, riding next to you?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Have you seen the writing on the wall?
Have you seen that writing?
Can you see the riders on the storm?
Can you see them riding?
Can you see them riding, riding next to you?
